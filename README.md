# FS_checker
This program will be used to read Famsearch via API to generate custom audit reports.  Specifically things like:  generate a list of people without sources for vital statiistcs (birth,death,marriage);  specific ordinances missing; etc  
Note: there is currently no code, because it requires an FS API key
